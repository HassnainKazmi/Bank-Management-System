# Bank-Management-System

Developed a bank management system that replicated the day-to-day transactions and activities of a genuine bank, utilizing concepts of OOP. The system was composed of two different interfaces, one for customers and another for bank management.

The customer interface provided a range of functionalities, including deposit and withdrawal options via checks or credit cards, viewing account balances and statements, as well as money transfers to other account holders. The bank management interface enabled account creation or deletion, editing of account holder information, and monitoring of the overall bank activity. To ensure financial compliance, I also implemented tax calculations into the transaction process.


Technologies Used: C++, Microsoft Visual Studio IDE
