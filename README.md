# Bank-Management-System

Developed a bank management system using object-oriented programming that closely replicated the day-to-day transactions and activities of a real bank. The system comprised two interfaces, one for customers and another for bank management. Customers could perform various functions, such as deposits and withdrawals via checks or credit cards, view account balances and statements, and transfer funds to other account holders. The bank management interface allowed for account creation and deletion, editing of account holder information, and monitoring of overall bank activity. To ensure financial compliance, tax calculations were integrated into the transaction process.
